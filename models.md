# Models
As explained in the Playlist Generate page, the goal of our model will be to predict the similarity score between two songs. In the sections below, we present the results from using all of the popular models studied in class: Linear Regression (with LASSO/Ridge regularization), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosted Trees, Neural Networks).
